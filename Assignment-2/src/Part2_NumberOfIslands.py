[Graphs - Ex5] Exercise: Number of islands

We are given a 2d grid map of '1's (land) and '0's (water). We define an island  as a body of land surrounded by
water and is formed by connecting adjacent lands horizontally or vertically. We may assume all four edges of the
grid are all surrounded by water. We need to write a method to find the number of islands in such a map.

Write a method nbOfIslands(bool[][] islandMap) that returns the number of islands in a 2dmap. For this exercise you
can think of a true in the islandMap representing a '1' (land) and a false in the islandMap representing a '0' (water).
